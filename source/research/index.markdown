ILC, the International Linear Collider is the next large basic science infrastructure to address frontier knowledge on the fundamental forces of Nature and on the origin of the Universe [1]. It is a particle accelerator complex including two 11 km long linear accelerators (linac) in an head-on configuration producing electron-positron collisions at 500 GeV (a million time the electron mass) and 1 TeV in a second phase [2],[3]. Although being much less greedy in term of electrical power than other linear or circular colliders, the center will consume ~ 180 MW at peak power, the equivalent of the consumption of a city of 200,000-300,000 residents.

The Green-ILC project, already presented in several conferences [4], is precisely addressing the large scale research infrastructure power consumption issues and the use of renewable energies. Beyond ILC, it is paving the way to any future high-energy collider (circular or linear) that will face the same issues, but on an even larger scale.

Green-ILC is a two-fold project. It is aiming first at powering the International Linear Collider in the most efficient and sustainable way and, second, at delivering to the society any advances in energy R&D thus obtained.

This short note addresses a large audience ranging from accelerator physicists and engineers, high-energy physicists, energy scientists and experts, industry researchers and leaders. It will essentially list the main topics to be covered by the Green-ILC project. It should help setting up dedicated workshop agendas and sharing the workload of international working groups.

Energy saving, energy recycling, sustainable energies, energy storage and distribution are the 5 main topics addressed here. Working group Charter will be setup and a proposed implementation time line in the ILC lifetime will be then discussed. If you are already convinced that getting into energy R&D is a necessity you can skip the next chapter.
