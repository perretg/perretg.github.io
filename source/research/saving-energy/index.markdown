All collider components must be considered. However those which account for most of the energy consumption should be studies with more details, as any gain in efficiency can induce large nominal saving. From the TDR part II (Technical Design Report) [2], the following power estimates are as follows:

The RF power with a 42% share is the main consumer, followed by the cryogenic system (23%), the normal conducting magnets (15%) and the rest (conventional normal and electronic racks) still amount to 16%. For the emergency, 5% or 9.2 MW are the minimum power needed to keep the system alive in case of short power cut.
 
Most of the ILC technologies were developed for the TESLA project started more than 20 years ago. Although many improvements have been brought to the basic collider elements, particularly thanks to the construction of the XFEL project in DESY which can be seen as a ILC prototype on many aspects, the basic parameters and technical choices have not very much evolved. Building the large ILC infrastructure expected to be operational in at least 12 years and with an expected running time of 10 to 20 years with extension to higher energies requires revisiting some of the technical choices in particular for achieving higher energy global efficiency.
