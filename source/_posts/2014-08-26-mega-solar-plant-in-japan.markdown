Marubeni Corp. (Tokyo) has held an opening ceremony for a 82 MW solar photovoltaic (PV) plant which it has commissioned in Southern Japan's ÅŒita Prefecture. This is the largest PV plant completed in Japan to date.

Marubeni began commercial operation of the Oita plant on March 12th, 2014, fifty days ahead of schedule, and began construction on the project in March 2013. Electricity from the plant is being sold to Kyushu Electric Power Co. Inc. (Fukuoka, Japan) under a 20-year contract.
