A first version of the Green-ILC site is now open. It will evolve with the needs.
It is supposed to cover all energy issues related to the ILC, but also to any future accelerators.
<!-- more -->
It is a forum open to all participants to the projects, in particular: 
HEP and accelerators physicists, industry researchers and decisions makers.
