The time has come to witness the largest solar thermal project in the world
With our parent company NRG Energy, Inc., along with Google, BrightSource Energy and other investors, we have built the largest solar thermal project in the world, which was completed in early 2014. Located near Ivanpah, Calif., in the Mojave Desert, the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System generates nearly 400 MW of electricity â€” nearly double the amount of commercial solar thermal energy now generated in the United States. Because of this, POWER Magazine crowned it the Plant of the Year, the highest honor.
